                <h2>Hey, I'm Caroline!</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm currently a student at
                    Hogeschool Rotterdam in the Netherlands. I am studying to be a
                    creative developer. Check out this website and get to know me!
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, let me tell you something about my hobbies and interests.
                    You might have noticed that the website is bird/nature themed. This is because I love going birdspotting.
                    I usually go birdspotting with my boyfriend, who has an very good camera.
                    The pictures you will find on this website are made with his camera, either by him or by me (mostly by him).
                    I also love being creative. Dancing, singing, drawing and writing are some creative things I like to do.
                </p>

              <p>For this project, my team and I had to make something for me, to make my life easier. 
                Since I have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, we made an alarmclock that drives away when it goes off.
              To turn it of, you have to complete a memory game.</p>
